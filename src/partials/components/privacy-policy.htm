            We use cookies to recognize and monitor users, their on-site
            behavior, and their preferences for accessing their website. These
            cookies include the IP and time of visits by visitors. Visitors to
            StaticMania that do not want cookies put on their browsers should

          <h2>3. When do we need to update this policy?</h2>
          <p>
            We will need to update this policy from time to time to ensure that
            it remains up-to-date with the latest legal requirements and any
            improvements to our privacy management practices.

            one of our email lists or indicated that you are interested in
            receiving deals or information from us), we will send you email
            marketing messages about products and services which we feel may be
            of interest to you. You can ‘opt-out’ of such communications if you
            would prefer not to receive them in the future by using the
